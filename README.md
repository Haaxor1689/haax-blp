# haax-blp

CLI utility to convert BLP textures to and from PNG images.

## Usage

```
haax-blp <...filePaths>

- `...filePaths`: Space-separated list of full paths to blp or png files. If a directory path is provided, it will be searched for all png files that will be converted to blp.

## Executable

You can also use this CLI as a standalone executable. Download `haax-blp.exe` for Windows or `haax-blp` for Linux. You can then drag & drop any files you want converted onto the executable.
